## Features and Benefits of the Oxford Picture Dictionary Third Edition
 
The Oxford Picture Dictionary Third Edition is more than just a dictionary. It is a complete language learning package that can help you master over 4,000 words in 12 thematic units. Each unit consists of several subtopics that cover different aspects of the main theme. For example, the unit on Food has subtopics such as Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner, Eating Out, Cooking and Recipes, Food Shopping and Nutrition. Each subtopic has a two-page spread with a large illustration on one page and a word list with definitions and examples on the other page.
 
The illustrations are one of the main strengths of the Oxford Picture Dictionary Third Edition. They are colorful, realistic and culturally diverse. They show people of different ages, genders, ethnicities and backgrounds in various situations and settings. They also include details and labels that help you learn more about the topic. For instance, in the illustration for Cooking and Recipes, you can see different types of pots, pans, utensils, appliances and ingredients. You can also see how to measure, chop, peel, grate, stir and bake different foods. The labels are clickable in the e-book version, so you can hear how to pronounce each word and see its definition.
 
The audio recordings are another feature that makes the Oxford Picture Dictionary Third Edition stand out from other picture dictionaries. The recordings are done by native speakers of English or the target language (Arabic, Chinese, French, Spanish or Vietnamese). They are clear, natural and accurate. They cover not only the words and labels in the illustrations, but also the sentences and examples in the word lists. You can listen to them online or offline in the e-book version. You can also record your own voice and compare it with the model pronunciation.
 
The interactive e-book version of the Oxford Picture Dictionary Third Edition adds even more value to the dictionary. It has many features that make learning fun and easy, such as:

- Interactive exercises and games that test your vocabulary, grammar, spelling and listening skills
- Progress checks and tests that track your performance and give you feedback
- Vocabulary flashcards that help you review and memorize the words
- Grammar and pronunciation videos that explain key points and show common mistakes
- Cultural notes and maps that provide useful information and tips about the culture and geography of English-speaking countries or the target language countries

The e-book is compatible with Windows 7 or higher (32-bit or 64-bit) and Mac OS X 10.9 or higher. You will need an internet connection to activate the e-book and access some of the online features. You can also use the e-book offline once it is downloaded to your device.
