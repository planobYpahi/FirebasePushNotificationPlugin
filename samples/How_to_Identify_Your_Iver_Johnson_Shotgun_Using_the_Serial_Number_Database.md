1. Locate the serial number on your shotgun. The serial number is usually found on the bottom of the barrel rib or the bottom of the trigger guard. It may consist of numbers only, numbers with a letter prefix or suffix, or letters only.
2. Use the code below to decipher the serial number if it is all letters. The letters spell out "FITCHBURG", which is the name of the town in Massachusetts where the company was based. Each letter corresponds to a digit as follows:

    | Letter | F | I | T | C | H | B | U | R | G |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

    | Number | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |

For example, a serial letter of BHFI becomes 6521.
3. Use the table below to find the year and model of your shotgun based on the serial number format and range. Note that some models have overlapping serial number ranges, so you may need to look at other features of your gun to confirm its identity.

    | Serial Number Format | Year Range | Model |
